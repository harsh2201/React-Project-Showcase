Converting ideas into reality that's what Engineers do right?

That's exactly what we did! Just another day when there was a meeting of Core Committee with Dr. Ritesh Patel sir for Smart Gujarat Hackathon hosted by our CHARUSAT on 27th-28th February 2020 with 1200+ participants and approximately 1400 people involved in it, an idea popped up into our minds that why can't we automate the whole attendance process and monitoring the count for each food session. So, here we are! We made the whole app in under 5 days along with deciding the whole working flow and testing.

It was whole another experience to implement the whole thing in real-time and not getting a SINGLE ERROR at RUNTIME!

Parental Control is all about assigning tasks by mentors to their followers.

You can use this app in 3 different ways!

* For Teachers and Students: Teachers can assign their tasks such as homework or any assignment so that their students can follow them in their flow.
* Between Friends: A person can remind their friends so that they don't forget any task.
* Parent and their Child: The parents can assign their work or can give them notes about anything.

Spark! is an android application that I created in my 3rd sem for my college in which the users can access the basic details about the faculties and also their weekly schedule. The users can also view the results of the students and the faculties can upload the results. There is also an option to view the lab vacancy for the labs.
